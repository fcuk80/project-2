#Space Invaders

For my second project. I've attempted to create the retro computer game Space Invaders. There was many learning curves but an overall enjoyable experinec and I even suprised myself how much I've learnt.

##Planning

For this project I wanted to keep things simply. In the planning stage.
Thinking about what I wanted to achieve I narrowed it down to

###alien
###shooter
###lazer

I then had to think about how i was gonna layout the page and for that i needed to create a wireframe. I used a site called figma to draw and design the wireframe, keeping as simple as possible.

I thought about how I can display the game on the webpage and found grid was easier to manipulate than flexbox.

###The next challenge was movement.

##Code

Using very little html and css, I began to write constants and variables on the page. Knowing how I would like to style it, I knew little else.

Using many online recourses such as W3C for tutrials along with youtube videos. I now had more of an idea on where to start. Thanks to the guidance from my tutor Kamal Karir, I knew what to look for and where.

##Challenges

My biggest learning curve, was definitely controlling the movement and direction of of alliens. As well as findind a function to restart the game once over.
