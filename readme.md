For my second project. I've attempted to create the retro computer game Space Invaders. There was many learning curves but an overall enjoyable experinec and I even suprised myself how much I've learnt.

## Planning

For this project I wanted to keep things simply. In the planning stage.
Thinking about what I wanted to achieve I narrowed it down to
<ul>
<li>alien</li>
<li>shooter</li>
<li>lazer</li>
</ul>

I then had to think about how i was gonna layout the page and for that i needed to create a wireframe. I used a site called figma to draw and design the wireframe, keeping as simple as possible.

I thought about how I can display the game on the webpage and found grid was easier to manipulate than flexbox.

### The next challenge was movement.

## Code

Using very little html and css, I began to write constants and variables on the page. Knowing how I would like to style it, I knew little else.

Using many online recourses such as W3C for tutrials along with youtube videos. I now had more of an idea on where to start. Thanks to the guidance from my tutor Kamal Karir, I knew what to look for and where.

## Challenges

My biggest learning curve, was definitely controlling the movement and direction of of alliens. As well as findind a function to restart the game once over.

## Target audience

As a gammer i wanted to bring back the nostalgia of retro video games.
I attempted to stick with the traditional theme and retro look.

## future development

More features will be added in future. Some of these will include.
<ul>
   <li>Speed up aliens to increase difficulty</li>
   <li>Add more lifes to increase the time playing the game</li>
   <li>Credit and continue prompting</li>
   <li>Add more stages with different aliens to shoot</li>
</ul>
   These features will make the game more like the original game.
